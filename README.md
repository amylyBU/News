# News

A project dabbling in React Native for the first time. <i>Disclaimer: Probably broken.</i>

## Features

1) GET request for news from the [News API](https://newsapi.org/)
2) Use of `react-navigation` as our navigation library

## Set up

Start the React Native server & run android or ios. 
You may also run the `.xcodeproj` in Xcode or open up and run `app/` in Android Studio
